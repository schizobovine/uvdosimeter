# UV Dosimeter

Microcontroller project to (somehow) get data from the SiLabs SI1145 UV index
sensor to a user such that they know when the daystar is out to kill them
(slowly, with cancer).

Various designs in the works, but the primary focus right now is a Bluetooth
4.0+ LE based sensor which communicates to a smart phone or watch for data
logging and handling any user interaction/warnings. This cuts out the need for
a display, controls (beyond a power switch), and notification system.
